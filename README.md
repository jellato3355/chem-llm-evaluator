Testing and improving GPT's understanding of IUPAC naming and Lewis structures.

# ChemStructPromptFixer

This project explores how GPT-based models (like ChatGPT) handle core chemistry tasks:

- Interpreting IUPAC names and generating Lewis structures
- Naming compounds from Lewis structure diagrams or descriptions

## Why This Matters

Accurate handling of basic chemical representations is essential for scientific use of AI. Current LLMs often make mistakes in:

- Parsing IUPAC names to correct structures
- Identifying compound names from drawn structures

## Goal

This project tests ChatGPTâ€™s performance on these tasks and demonstrates prompt engineering strategies that improve results.
